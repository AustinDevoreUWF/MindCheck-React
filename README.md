# MindCheck
This project is a very simple way to track your habbits one week at a time. It uses Re-charts to graph the info as the user submits it via sliders that the user inputs each day based on the way they felt about the different aspects of their day. After the week is up the user will see which days had a lower score and will be able to hover over the graph seeing which specific aspect of their day likely caused the low score. Conversly tehy may see a high scoring day and want to replicate the aspects that likely led to a positive day!
